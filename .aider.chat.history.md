#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the title, description, ogTitle, and ogDescription values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create this new file with the logo description.  

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Token Holder Distribution Analyzer logo: a stylized representation of a pie chart with segments of varying sizes, each segment colored in a gradient from blue to green, with a subtle 3D effect. The chart sits on a clean white background, with a small, modern sans‑serif font label “Token Holder Distribution Analyzer” below the chart in dark gray. The overall composition is balanced and conveys data insight and clarity.
