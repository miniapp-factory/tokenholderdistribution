Token Holder Distribution Analyzer logo: a stylized representation of a pie chart with segments of varying sizes, each segment colored in a gradient from blue to green, with a subtle 3D effect. The chart sits on a clean white background, with a small, modern sans‑serif font label “Token Holder Distribution Analyzer” below the chart in dark gray. The overall composition is balanced and conveys data insight and clarity.
